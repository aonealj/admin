#Agenda

##Vending Machine Updates (4 minutes)
  - $551.78 sold as of 7:15 P.M. 11/14
      -  breaking things up per month to see if goals were reached
      -  Chip is working on modifying
  - Stuck Parts. Is the battery getting stuck a situation that should be looked into further? What should be done to prevent this in the furture? Masking tape? (Kyle Izzy Alis)
      -  if this cant be fixed it should it be removed? extras in case of future issue?
      -  lockbox extras or just extras
      -  "see makerspace if there is issues" written somewhere?
      -  Google number instead of Owen's number - done by end of thanksgiving
      -  more people involved in fixing the vending machine (in pairs)? making one of the keys available to everyone
      -  Kyle and Chip = research and present at next meeting best system
        - Current system:
          - Tim has both keys to lockbox to key of vending machine. (Worst case scenario if something happens)
          - Kyle and Izzy both have 1 of the required keys to open lockbox to access key to the vending machine.
          - Owen's number still on vending machine. Kyle working on it to make a Google voice #.
        - Suggested new system:
          - Google voice would call Kyle and he would notify the interns about the situation (if he isn't available).
          - Each intern have one of the keys (A or B)
          - For example: Cole and I work together most days. He would have key A and I would have key B.
          - Whenever there would be an incident, chances are high he and I would be on campus/working to retrieve part.
