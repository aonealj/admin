# Agenda

## Incident Report
1. Review the incident with all staff, and emphasize that SAFETY is everyoneâ€™s highest priority in the Makerspace.
2. Discuss the proper procedure for changing filament, and make sure that the Makerspace Operations Manual is updated to agree with the outcome of your discussion.
3. Discuss the identification and location of pinch point hazards in the Makerspace
4. Discuss proper response to pinching incidents
5. Identify modified procedure (or ppe)  that would reduce likelihood of injuries from pinch points, and review budget to prioritize PPE purchases and training on equipment that would reduce the risk of injury.
6.       Summarize action plan identifying root cause of injury, and actions that will be taken to reduce the risk of future incidents with pinch points (e.g. PPE, revised training, improved policies, etc.)

# Discussion
#### Options
Two operators on one machine?  
One operator can operate dozens - what's protocol?

General policy of one operator on a machine at a time  
Servicing the machine should be considered operator - very different from observer

Any of 5 operators can control any of 17 printers

Is it possible to have an LED on when somebody is controlling the machine or when it is running?  
Bright red bulb that senses when somebody is about to control

Before anyone touches a machine they have to check to see if someone is at a Computer
- Announce that they're going to touch 10307?
- Announce that they're going to start a print on 10307?

Move printers closer to the glass and only allow staff to access the printers

If you are going to service - unplug it from ethernet
- (Maybe label the ethernet on the front so you can disconnect on the switch)
- Not a LOTO solution - it would require the perfect storm for someone to plug it in and start a print at the same time
- Service Tags
- This becomes a big process for a 30 second service event

#### Hazard identification stickers
- Danger Hot
- Caution Pinch Point

Best to have something on each machine  
Small little vinyl decal?  

# Action plan
- [ ] Warning signs on machine
- [ ] Simple LOTO solution
    - Unplugging it is fine
- [ ] Document policy changes in operations manual
