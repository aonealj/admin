# Agenda

## Incident Report
1. Review the incident with all staff, and emphasize that SAFETY is everyone’s highest priority in the Makerspace.
    - Alis's pinch
2. Discuss the proper procedure for changing filament, and make sure that the Makerspace Operations Manual is updated to agree with the outcome of your discussion.
    1. Move extruder to changing position
    2. Heat printer to filament melting points
    3. get new spool
    4. pull old spool out
    5. put new spool on
    6. undo idler
    7. push filament through until it is hot end

- Tablet to allow for staff operation of printers
- Students don't know how long to watch the printers

3. Discuss the identification and location of pinch point hazards in the Makerspace
    - Pinch point is when hand gets caught in between two things
    - Can pinch anything

    - Laser Cutter (behind maintenance panels)
    - 3D printers
    - Button Maker
    - Vinyl Cutters
    - CNC Load Command


4. Discuss proper response to pinching incidents
    - Tell someone
    - Turn off the machine
    - Consider attempting to free appendage - i.e. manually rotate the motors
    - If still stuck call 911


5. Identify modified procedure (or ppe)  that would reduce likelihood of injuries from pinch points, and review budget to prioritize PPE purchases and training on equipment that would reduce the risk of injury.
    - One operator / machine
    - No known PPE
    - Consider allowing more vertical space on 3D Printers and requiring filament change through top of Lulzbot Minis
    - Consider switching / closing tab for a printer you are operating on

6. Summarize action plan identifying root cause of injury, and actions that will be taken to reduce the risk of future incidents with pinch points (e.g. PPE, revised training, improved policies, etc.)
    - Label Pinch Points


## Incident Report
1. Review the incident with all staff, and emphasize that SAFETY is everyone’s highest priority in the Makerspace.
    - Staff was trying to move extruder to clear a clog and accidentally made contact with the hotend
2. Discuss the proper procedure for work near hotends, and make sure that the Makerspace Operations Manual is updated to agree with the outcome of your discussion.

3. Discuss the identification and location of hotends in the Makerspace
4. Discuss proper response to pinching incidents
5. Identify modified procedure (or ppe)  that would reduce likelihood of injuries from hotends, and review budget to prioritize PPE purchases and training on equipment that would reduce the risk of injury.
    - Consider 3D printer training manual update or quiz question that has users identify which parts are hot
6. Summarize action plan identifying root cause of injury, and actions that will be taken to reduce the risk of future incidents with hotends (e.g. PPE, revised training, improved policies, etc.)
    - Be aware of where your hands are, and where the hazards are

## Impact
How do we measure impact?
    - Survey students - video / voice / word doc / Instagram
        - Tiger Vision - maker of the day?
    - Consider adding "One Click" survey question to student signin
        - Limit it to low-use times
    - Mass email survey
        - Extra time on the laser / 3D printer / ???

## Laser Cutters
- Cole: How are no-shows tracked on the laser reservations?
