`The above hours do not include any time to setup before or cleanup after a shift. This is not reflective of real life.`

We have 8 remaining weeks to hit our Dec 1st closing date.  
Target to hit is 160 hours total. If you are at 60 hours now that means you will have to do 12.5 hours /week.  
These hours include all Makerspace activities - work, meetings, training, and UPIC assignments. Make sure to log all hours that you work, and plan to stop immediately when you hit 160.  
December 8th is last day to log hours, submit assignments, and complete final evaluations

- Midway steam day on Oct 13th from 9:30am - 1:00pm

## Printer Status Update
- Mini-9 is back up and running and louder than ever
    - Possibly consider [motor dampers](https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/moons-nema-17-stepper-motor-damper)
- Mini-3 is still down and Mini-1 is still possibly a little hot - Izzy re-emailed the information to Lulzbot
    - Consider using personal emails rather than makerspace@clemson when working with Lulzbot
        - It seems there are weird issues with their emails to Makerspace
- Any updates from Alice w/ regard to updating training to include print log?
- Camera cables are in the mail and should be here soon

## Laser Cutter Lens & Mirror Cleaning
- The lenses on the laser cutter need to be cleaned frequently
- Plan to make it a part of daily setup or cleanup procedure

## SLA

- [x] Alton O'Neal
- [ ] Chip Miller
- [x] Cole DeMarco
- [x] Izzy Gebhart
- [x] Owen Phillips


1. Students interested in using the Formlabs must complete GWS and FDM certifications
2. Students should slice in Preform on the Makerspace laptop and print to the appropriate printer
3. Staff member will start the printer, and then remove, wash, and cure the part when done (we currently do not have training for students to handle the resin)
    - If the part takes up a substantial amount of volume encourage the student to look into alternatives such as [hollowing out the part](https://formlabs.com/blog/how-to-hollow-out-3d-models/)

We have a limited selection of resins available for students to use. If they would like to bring their own in they will need a [Form 2 Resin Tank](https://formlabs.com/store/us/form-2/buy-accessories/). These tanks are good for about 2 liters of resin, or 6 months of shelf life - whichever is sooner. They will also need to provide the resin, and SDS. Direct any further questions to Owen.


## CNC
- [ ] Alis Zamiar (but not in canvas)
- [ ] Alton O'Neal
- [ ] Chip Miller
- [x] Cole DeMarco (but not in canvas)
- [x] Izzy Gebhart
- [x] Owen Phillips

We are currently really low on double sided tape. Nolan should be putting in a procurement order for more today.  

We have a limited number of Single Sided PCB blanks left `TODO: Get current count` and we still need all the staff to complete training with them. Once staff have completed the training we can consider providing some of our remaining tax-paid stock to students with a clear and justified need. This would be at the supervising staff member's discretion.

## Vending
- Delayed due to awkward size of goods
    - Cromer is confident everything will fit but had to order special shelves
    - Could potentially be several weeks before machine is 100% ready
- Owen told Cromer that we don't need the machine to be 100% - just want it up ASAP
- Cromer hopes to have an update for us by Wednesday 2017-10-04
- Lease payments will be prorated to the effective date
