Incident 2017-09-07 - Minor cut from Box Cutter
1. Review the incident with all staff, and emphasize that SAFETY is everyoneâ€™s highest priority in the Makerspace.
2. Discuss what is the proper response by staff to a small cut that draws blood, and make sure that the Makerspace Operations Manual is updated to agree with the outcome of your discussion.
3. Discuss the training users receive on reporting incidents, and update policies, procedures, and manuals as needed to emphasize the importance of users reporting incidents (after treating any injury that may be associated with incident).
    - First point of contact is the intern
    - Change training to read talk to intern - not call 911
        - Possible poster directing students to shout out
    - Develop policy on what equipment can be used / if the space needs to close when a user is injured and staff are assisting
4. Discuss what is the proper training for post processing to reduce likelihood of injury.
    - Cut away from yourself is in the canvas
    - Deburring tool > Xacto > Box Cutter ?
5. Identify PPE (and other types of cutting instruments)  that would reduce likelihood of injuries from razors during post processing, and review budget to prioritize PPE purchases and training on equipment that would reduce the risk of injury.
    - Deburring tools, gloves, vices, aprons
    -
6. Summarize action plan identifying root cause of injury, and actions that will be taken to reduce the risk of future incidents with razors in post processing (e.g. PPE, revised training, improved policies, etc.)
