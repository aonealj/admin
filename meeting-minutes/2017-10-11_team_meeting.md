# Agenda

## Policy on Closure in Special Circumstances
- Power Outages, Hurricanes, Snow Storms, etc.
- During Monday's power outage we ascertained at approximately 8:00am that power was out in the Watt
    - Owen and Cole decided to close the space during the 8:30am - 9:30am session
        - Cole emailed the two students who had laser reservations and told them we would be closed
    - Sometime between 8:10am and 8:41am the power came back on
    - As early as 8:41am students were waiting outside the Makerspace in order to cut
    - Tim Pruett accidentally assisted a few students with using the space, and Cole arrived around 9:10am.
    - The computers were all off and apparently did not operate as expected
- Should we send out mass closure notifications during special circumstances?
    - Possible options
        1. Email entire list
        2. Canvas Announcement
        3. Text students with laser reservation who shared phone number on reserve.cuMaker.space
        4. Post a paper sign on the door
            - Tim Pruett has volunteered to post signs in this situation
        - We chose the canvas announcement as the best option.
            - Also have a poster to remind students to check canvas to any change in hours.

-	Cole asked about a scenario that if power goes out at 8:00am and comes back on at 8:30, do we open back up from 8:30 to 9 or just close the whole morning and open back up at 3:30?
    - Morning Shift wait 15 minutes to see if power comes back on power comes back on.
    - Afternoon(s) shift wait 30 minutes to see if power comes back on.
- If notified about class being cancelled from the University, don't go to work.
- If power goes out at 4 and stays off for 30 minutes, that shift leaves. The 6pm shift needs to show up to at least check and see if power comes back on.
    - Maybe email Tim Pruett and/or Blythe and ask him to check for us to save time.
    - Or call front desk.


## Maintenance
- We need to order more hotends for the TAM printers
    - Alis - 10306 is down after a hotend malfunctioned - possible issues with the electronics may have resulted
    - Order new hotend (and maybe more for extras or the other printers).
- Izzy - Mini-3 mount should arrive in the mail soon
- Izzy - Mini-1 Need to follow-up with Lulzbot about - they want pictures of the machine
- Izzy - 10310 the fan needs to be replaced, there should be a bunch in the Type A Core Supply Kits - Alis, Cole, or Owen should be able to demonstrate how to do it.
- Owen - Mini-4 It looks like this printer failed to Auto Bed Level, and dragged the nozzle through the PEI sheet. Can someone take ownership of possibly sanding the sheet down or (most likely) replacing the entire sheet?
    - An intern will replace the PEI Sheet. Sanding down not worth the time.

## Lulzbot Cameras
- All of the appropriate camera cables have arrived
- Owen is trying to find bolts to hold the cameras to the railing

## SDS
- No updates from last week
