## Impact
How do we measure impact?
    - Survey students - video / voice / word doc / Instagram
        - Tiger Vision - maker of the day?
          - I looked into this and found there is a fee for having them do this. Would it be better for us to just rent a camera and tripod from the library and film ourselves?
            - We still even want this option?
    - Consider adding "One Click" survey question to student signin
        - Limit it to low-use times
    - Mass email survey
        - Extra time on the laser / 3D printer / ???

## Space Maintenance
Consider adding to maintenance list
- Empty water bucket from dehumidifier when red light is lit.
  - Located in the corner by the Type A's
- Very important to keep humidity low to help preserve the filament.

## Inventory
- Filament inventory system is now up to date
  - Please keep it updated! Very important for ITSAB funding for next year.
  - Best way to keep track of inventory out?
    - Sheet of paper and pencil in each cabinet containing filament and simply mark when you took a box?
      - Then someone be accountable for looking at those sheets each day/week and log them in the Drive
    - Just be accountable for marking it in the Google Drive inventory sheet when you take a box? (Show my example)
    - QR or NFC code on each box or in the cabinets that links you to the drive?
- Laser Cutter filter inventory conducted 10/27
  - Pre-filters: 0
  - HEPA filter: 1
  - Gas filter: 1
  - Duct tape: last roll
    - Any filters/duct tape ordered?
      - If not, how do we go about doing this?
