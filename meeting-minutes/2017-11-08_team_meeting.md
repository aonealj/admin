# Agenda

$282.35 sold as of 6:43 P.M. 11/07
- Thanks Izzy and Kyle for tracking that.
- Are we meeting our minimum amount to keep machine?
  - $63 minimum in rental fee monthly

## Summer questions
- Tim brought up a question of running the Space over the Summer
  - To fund, do we charge a fee to student org heads ($75?).
  - Host Summer Camps and receive funding from Watt possibly.
    - Girl Scout STEM summer Camps

## Key 84
- Kyle now has responsibility over the vending machine.
  - If any problems arise related to the vending machine, notify Kyle.
  - His number (Google voice number) will soon be on the machine as the number to call for assistance.
  - Kyle: Make the Makerspace Google voice number

## DTG Procurement Update
- Update from Cole
  - Melco
    - Epson F2000 ($21,900 for printer, plate, set of ink (normally $800), software, pre-treatment machine, hot press, site-visit training).
    - Software ($2000-$3000)
    - Cole: 11-20-17 have 3 vendors knowing we need it. Then present to the group.
    - Staff meeting moved to 11-20 (Monday) instead of that Wednesday because of the Holidays.
      - Alis organize the time and room for that Staff meeting. Have done by 11-15 at beginning of staff meeting.

## Impact
How do we measure impact?
- Survey students - video / voice / word doc / Instagram
    - Tiger Vision - maker of the day?
      - I looked into this and found there is a fee for having them do this. Would it be better for us to just rent a camera and tripod from the library and film ourselves?
        - We still even want this option?
      - Talk to Blythe about student spotlight
        - Chip: Email Blythe about getting this setup
- Consider adding "One Click" survey question to student signin
    - Limit it to low-use times
- Mass email survey
    - Extra time on the laser / 3D printer / ???
    - Typically good results.
    - Send out around the week of Makerday (November 30th)
    - Discuss next meeting


## Space Maintenance
Consider adding to maintenance list
- Empty water bucket from dehumidifier when red light is lit.
  - Located in the corner by the Type A's
- Very important to keep humidity low to help preserve the filament.


## Inventory
- Filament inventory system is now up to date
  - Please keep it updated! Very important for ITSAB funding for next year.
  - Best way to keep track of inventory out?
    - Sheet of paper and pencil in each cabinet containing filament and simply mark when you took a box?
      - Then someone be accountable for looking at those sheets each day/week and log them in the Drive
    - Just be accountable for marking it in the Google Drive inventory sheet when you take a box? (Show my example)
    - QR or NFC code on each box or in the cabinets that links you to the drive?
- Laser Cutter filter inventory conducted 10/27
  - Pre-filters: 0
  - HEPA filter: 1
  - Gas filter: 1
  - Duct tape: last roll
    - Any filters/duct tape ordered?
      - If not, how do we go about doing this?
  - Need filter space in cabinets. Obtain more from Watt. Get cabinet similar to vending machine with key because of cost of filters.
      - Chip: Get quote for more filters ASAP
        - Filter Model: FA-2

## Hour Requirement

## Parts Log
- How do we hold students accountable for logging parts?
- Compared to last year, we have a ton of unlogged parts or incomplete logs.
  - Tag students and send an email and say "log your parts"
    - Alton: Look into this (Or Alis)
- Interns; keep printer status up to date.

## Laser Cutter Reservations
- Cole suggested adding a notification to the reservation page to tell students to have their files completed before coming in for their time.
  - Or come half hour early to prepare your file.
- It is already on the page
  Can we make it bigger?
  - Consider adding a notification for laser cutter system letting us know it's their first time cutting for certification
    - Alton: Research a way to do this by 11-15-17

## Incident Reporting

- Reporting incidents through an app on iPhone
- Discuss next meeting
  - Izzy: Do a little report on this app and present to the group (Dr. Todd has more info)
