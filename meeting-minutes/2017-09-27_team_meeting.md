# Agenda

SLA Usage
- Send students to talk to Cole or Owen
- Alton did some work cleaning the Formlabs
- Rubbing Alcohol and Acrylic DO NOT MIX

Laser Reservations
- Reservations happen on a weekly basis
    - A student is limited to 3 half hour reservations in a calendar week
    - Students are also only allowed to make 3 half hour reservations in the future
    - This means that a student who misses a reservation is penalized, unless we delete their missed reservation.
    - Maybe we make a drop-in account that is used for all drop-in reservations
- Policy on back to back reservations
    - Students are currently limited to reservations in half hour blocks
        - This means that a reservation of an hour would show up as two reservations
        - Student A reserves 6:00pm - 6:30pm and 6:30pm - 7:00 pm
        - Student B shows up at 6:00pm waits until 6:10pm when A is declared a no show
        - B takes over the reservation and at 6:30pm Student A shows up to use the 2nd half of his reservation
        - Should A be able to kick B off?

FDM Printers
- Don't put ABS on the printers
- Anything but ABS
- Discuss spool orientation on Type A Machine Printers
