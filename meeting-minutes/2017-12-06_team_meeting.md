# Agenda

## Vending Machine Updates (15 minutes)
- total sold: $652.00 as of 11-28-2017
  - Stuck Parts. Is the battery getting stuck a situation that should be looked into further? What should be done to prevent this in the future? Masking tape? (Kyle Izzy Alis)
    - Current system:
      - Tim has both keys to lockbox to key of vending machine. (Worst case scenario if something happens)
      - Kyle and Izzy both have 1 of the required keys to open lockbox to access key to the vending machine.
      - Owen's number still on vending machine. Kyle working on it to make a Google voice #.
    - Meeting suggestion: Can't have the two interns working leave the space. Have the Watt security Guard (or Tim) have key "B" and we all have key "A". He can be the other person to verify the transaction and fix.
      - Izzy - Find a way to get more "A" keys
    - Close vending machine after finals for the 2.5 weeks that Watt is open that interns aren't present.


## DTG Procurement Update (7 minutes)
  - Update from Cole: 11-20-17 have 3 vendors knowing we need it.
      - Leaning towards Epson F2000 ($22k)
      - Have the DTG limited to students to a couple of uses so they aren't making club shirts.
      - Consider best value bid. Request that we need to see local references of the machine working.
      - Get done ASAP. Deadline to start printing: Spring Break

## Staffing for next semester (7 minutes)
  - How is hiring process going? Can interns help with anything?


## Hendrix Makerspace Proposal Petition (7 minutes)
  - Update from Owen: any news on progress/ outcome? How can the staff support?

## It's been a great semester!
