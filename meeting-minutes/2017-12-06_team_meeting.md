# Agenda

## Vending Machine Updates (15 minutes)
- total sold: $652.00 as of 11-28-2017
  - Stuck Parts. Is the battery getting stuck a situation that should be looked into further? What should be done to prevent this in the future? Masking tape? (Kyle Izzy Alis)
    - Current system:
      - Tim has both keys to lockbox to key of vending machine. (Worst case scenario if something happens)
      - Kyle and Izzy both have 1 of the required keys to open lockbox to access key to the vending machine.
      - Owen's number still on vending machine. Kyle working on it to make a Google voice #.
    - Meeting suggestion: Can't have the two interns working leave the space. Have the Watt security Guard (or Tim) have key "B" and we all have key "A". He can be the other person to verify the transaction and fix.
      - Izzy - Find a way to get more "A" keys
        - 8 keys need to be made
        - Figure out how to pay online and have the Makerspace pay for them.
    - Close vending machine on 12-15-2017
      - Izzy and Kyle
    - Kyle: figure out Google voice
      - Kyle: Get with Owen to use Makerspace account
        - Done by 12-15-2017

## DTG Procurement Update (7 minutes)
  - Update from Cole: 11-20-17 have 3 vendors knowing we need it.
      - Leaning towards Epson F2000 ($22k)
      - Have the DTG limited to students to a couple of uses so they aren't making club shirts.
      - Consider best value bid. Request that we need to see local references of the machine working.
      - Cole: Get done ASAP. Deadline to start printing: Spring Break (March 19th, 2018)
    - Sample from Melco arriving next week
    - Cole: ask Melco how often to use cleaning kit and what a "day" means.
    - Cole: Look for a guarantee of consistent cartridge type
    - Cole: Ask about shelf life for ink. Does it expire if it sits unused for a certain amount of time
    - Cole: Bid needs to be out by early March
    - Cole and Owen: January 10th, get game plan together

## Next semester closing
